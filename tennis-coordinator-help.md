## How It Works

### Check-In Priority
- **First-come, first-served** based on check-in time
- Earlier check-ins get priority in match organization

### Match Organization Rules

**Doubles Matches:**
- Formed from first 4 players who selected "Doubles" or "Either"
- Organized by check-in order
- Time preferences shown but not enforced (group negotiates)
- Need 4+ people for doubles

**Singles Matches:**
- Formed from players who selected "Singles" or "Either" (if not in doubles)
- **Requires time overlap** - won't pair people with conflicting times
- **Respects exclusion preferences** - won't pair excluded players
- Need 2+ people for singles

**Remaining Players:**
- 3 people: Rotation (choose 1v1 or 1v2 format)
- 2 people: Singles match (if compatible)
- 1 person: Waiting list

---

## Play Style Options

**Singles Only**
- Only paired for singles matches
- Never placed in doubles

**Doubles Only**
- Only placed in doubles matches
- If not enough for doubles, goes to waiting

**Either** (Most Flexible)
- First grouped for doubles if enough players
- If not used in doubles, available for singles
- Recommended for maximum flexibility

---

## 3-Player Rotation Preference

**Willing to Play Rotation (Default: Checked)**
- When checked, you can be placed in a 3-player rotation group
- Rotation groups form when exactly 3 compatible players remain
- Choose between 1v1 rotation (singles practice) or 1v2 rotation (Australian doubles)
- If unchecked, you'll only be placed in standard doubles or singles matches
- All 3 players must have this checked for rotation to form

**When to uncheck:**
- If you only want traditional 2-person or 4-person matches
- If you prefer to wait for a standard match rather than rotate

---

## Time Availability

**How to Use:**
- Leave blank = Available any time
- Enter start time only = "from X onwards"
- Enter end time only = "until X"
- Enter both = Specific window (e.g., 2:00PM-5:00PM)

**Important:**
- Times enforced for **singles matches only**
- Times shown but ignored for doubles (group coordinates)
- No time overlap = players placed in waiting, not paired

**Examples:**
- ✅ 9:00AM-11:00AM + 10:00AM-12:00PM = Can play (overlap 10-11AM)
- ❌ 9:00AM-11:00AM + 12:00PM-5:00PM = Cannot play (no overlap)
- ✅ Blank + any time = Always compatible

---

## Partner Preferences (Singles Only)

Access via ⚙️ Preferences button next to your name.

**Exclude Players:**
- System will not pair you with excluded players in singles matches
- Applies only to singles matches (not doubles or rotation)
- If exclusions prevent pairing, you'll be placed in waiting
- Preferences are private and persist across all dates
- No visible indication that exclusions are set

## Rules & Etiquette

1. **Check in only if you can actually play**
   - Don't reserve spots "just in case"
   
2. **Update your time accurately**
   - Helps everyone coordinate better
   - Be realistic about your availability

3. **Remove yourself if plans change**
   - Click "Remove" next to your name
   - Frees up spot for others

4. **Respect exclusion preferences**
   - If someone excludes you, don't take it personally
   - Focus on playing with compatible partners

5. **Coordinate final time as a group**
   - Check everyone's time windows
   - Find overlap that works for all
   - Use WhatsApp to confirm

6. **First check-in gets priority**
   - Don't check in super early to game the system
   - Be reasonable (check in when you actually know)

7. **Guests are welcome**
   - Make sure your guest understands the level
   - You're responsible for your guest's behavior

## Common Scenarios

**"I'm in waiting list"**
- Not enough players with compatible times
- Exclusion preferences preventing pairing
- Coordinate with others to find overlapping time

**"Match shows time conflict"**
- Warning: some players have non-overlapping times
- Group needs to negotiate a common time
- For doubles only (singles won't match with conflicts)

**"I want to change my check-in"**
- Remove yourself, then check in again
- Loses your original check-in time priority

**"Same person checked in twice"**
- System prevents this
- Contact admin if you see duplicates

**"I forgot the PIN"**
- Ask any group member or admin
- PIN is shared among all members

## Match Organization Examples

**Example 1: 8 Players**
- All select "Either", no time restrictions
- Result: 2 doubles matches

**Example 2: 6 Players**
- 4 select "Either", 2 select "Singles"
- Result: 1 doubles match (first 4) + 1 singles match (remaining 2)

**Example 3: 5 Players**
- 3 select "Doubles", 2 select "Singles"
- Result: 3 in waiting (need 4 for doubles) + 1 singles match (if times overlap)

**Note on 3-Person Rotation:**
When 3 compatible players remain, they can choose rotation format:

**1v1 Rotation (Singles):**
- 2 players on court play singles
- 1 player waits off court
- After each game/set, players rotate
- Everyone gets equal singles practice

**1v2 Rotation (Australian Doubles):**
- 1 player on one side vs 2 players on other side
- Rotate positions after each game
- More continuous play, good practice
- Challenges for the solo player

**Example 4: 4 Players with Time Conflicts**
- 2 available 9-11AM, 2 available 2-5PM
- All select "Singles"
- Result: 2 singles matches (within each time group)

**Example 5: Exclusions**
- Alice excludes Bob
- Both select "Singles" 
- Result: Both in waiting (cannot pair due to exclusion)

---

## Tips for Success

1. **Be flexible with times** - increases matching chances
2. **Select "Either"** - get into more matches
3. **Check in early** - better position in queue
4. **Keep preferences minimal** - too many exclusions = fewer matches
5. **Use WhatsApp** - coordinate final details after matches form
6. **Check weather** - plan accordingly (shown for next 14 days when hosted)
