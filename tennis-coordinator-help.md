## 📋 How Game Organization Works

### Priority System
⏰ **First-come, first-served** based on check-in time

### Game Formation Order

**1️⃣ Doubles Games (Groups of 4)**
- Takes first 4 players who selected "Doubles" or "Either"
- Check-in order determines priority
- Time shown but not enforced (you coordinate)

**2️⃣ Singles Games (Pairs)**
- Pairs remaining players who selected "Singles" or "Either"
- ⚠️ **Requires overlapping time windows**
- ⚠️ **Respects exclusion preferences**

**3️⃣ Remaining Players**
- **3 people** → Rotation (1v1 or 1v2)
- **2 people** → Singles (if compatible)
- **1 person** → Waiting list

---

## 🏸 Play Style Guide

### Singles Only 🎯
**Best for:** Players who prefer 1v1 games
- ✅ Only paired for singles games
- ❌ Never placed in doubles
- ⚠️ May wait if no compatible partners

### Doubles Only 🎾
**Best for:** Players who prefer 2v2 games
- ✅ Only placed in doubles games (groups of 4)
- ❌ Never in singles or rotation
- ⚠️ Goes to waiting if less than 4 doubles players

### Either ⚡ (Recommended)
**Best for:** Maximum flexibility
- 1️⃣ First considered for doubles
- 2️⃣ Then available for singles if not in doubles
- 3️⃣ Can be in rotation groups
- ✅ Best chance of getting a game

---

## 🔄 3-Player Rotation

### What Is It?
When exactly 3 compatible players remain, they can form a rotation group

### Format Options

**🎯 1v1 Rotation (Singles Practice)**
- 2 players on court, 1 waits
- Rotate after each game/set
- Everyone gets equal practice time

**🎾 1v2 Rotation (Australian Doubles)**
- 1 player vs 2 players
- Rotate positions after each game
- More continuous play

### Your Preference
- ✅ **Checked** → Can be placed in rotation (default)
- ⬜ **Unchecked** → Only standard games

**Note:** All 3 players must allow rotation for it to form

---

## ⏰ Time Windows

### How It Works

**Leave Blank**
- Available anytime
- ✅ Matches with everyone

**Start Time Only**
- Available "from X onwards"
- Example: 2:00 PM → Available 2 PM and later

**End Time Only**
- Available "until X"
- Example: 5:00 PM → Available anytime before 5 PM

**Both Times**
- Specific window
- Example: 2:00 PM - 5:00 PM

### Important Rules

⚠️ **Singles Games ONLY**
- Time overlap required for pairing
- No overlap = both go to waiting

✅ **Doubles Games**
- Times shown but not enforced
- Group coordinates together

### Examples

| Player A | Player B | Result |
|----------|----------|--------|
| 9 AM - 11 AM | 10 AM - 12 PM | ✅ Can play (10-11 AM overlap) |
| 9 AM - 11 AM | 12 PM - 5 PM | ❌ Can't play (no overlap) |
| Blank | Any time | ✅ Always compatible |
| 2 PM - 5 PM | 3 PM - 4 PM | ✅ Can play (3-4 PM overlap) |
