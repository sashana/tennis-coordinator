**December 2025 Update**

Hi everyone! Your Tennis Coordinator app just got a major upgrade. Here are the key improvements that make coordination even easier:

---

## 📱 **Better Mobile Experience**

Your app now works better on your phone:
- **Bigger buttons** - Easy to tap, no more missed clicks

## ⚡ **Faster & Smoother**

## 🔔 **Stay Updated**

## 📊 **Activity History**

**Know what changed:**

- Track member additions and changes
- View when matches were manually arranged
- Filter by activity type (check-ins, notes, members, etc.)

**Why this helps:** No more wondering "Who dropped?" or "Did someone check in?" - just open Activity to see everything that happened.

## 👥 **Member Management**

**For everyone:**
